## Description

My portfolio site created to showcase my projects and technical skills as a developer.

## Technology

-   [React](https://reactjs.org/)
-   [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
-   [FormSpree](https://formspree.io/)

## Design

Designed with a minimalist asthetic that prioritizes user experience, navigation, and ease of use. Flexbox provides a responsive layout to display appropriately on any screen size. The CSS and light animations are cusotom to distinguish components from those of commonly used librarires.
